                        also it removes the pathogens from the

                        In the modern era of Information technology, Tech Expo aims to provide knowledge about IT
                        related technologies right from evolution of various computer technologies. Over last few
                        decades knowledge related with Android Projects, different programming
                        languages, hardware components..</p>
                    <p class="m-3"> The Tech Expo is organized to show theoretical concepts, studied mostly in books, in
                        reality that will help the student to clear the concepts. The event is suitable for every one
                        like Students , their Parents Teachers.</p>

                    <p class="m-3"> Tech Expo is the paramount event organized by the MGM College to enhance the special
                        skills of student so that they could get good exposure, knowledge about the subject and recent
                        updates. Tech Expo not only gives information to students
                        in different dimensions but also it gives 360 degree learning skills to students. Tech Expo is
                        an excellent medium of delivering information to the students. </p>

                            feedback</a>, and information processing</a>.<br>
                            These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate
                            human actions. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are
                            used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection</a> and de-activation</a>),
                            manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but
                            some are made to resemble humans in appearance.

                            cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by
